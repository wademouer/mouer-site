My name is Wade Mouer. I am currently a Master's Candidate in Analytics at the Institute for Advanced Analytics. I am actively seeking employment as a Data Scientist. 

Creative problem-solving has always been my niche. I have been a math nerd since I was in kindergarten, when my older brother taught me multiplication tables. In high school, I got my first tastes of Statistics and Computer Science courses, and I was hooked. I completed my Bachelor's Degree from the University of North Carolina at Asheville in 2020, majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science, with additional coursework in Statistics. 

From UNC Asheville, I moved on to the M.S. in Analytics program at the Institute for Advanced Analytics, where I am set to graduate in May 2021. The topics of study covered at the IAA include regression, data mining, time series analysis and forecasting, text analytics, machine learning techniques, survival analysis, optimization, and big data technologies, among many others. 

I specialize in using R for data science -- in particular, I prefer using the `tidyverse` family of packages and related technologies, such as R Shiny and R Markdown. This site, for example, was put together using the `blogdown` package. I am at my best when forming creative approaches to data problems, discovering how we can use data to effect real change and meaningful insights for stakeholders. 

When not working with data, you could find me spending time with my partner, Cecilia, and our golden retriever, Scooter. I also love to cook and I am passionate about *good* coffee. 

Feel free to reach out to me via email if you would like to work together on a project!
