# Hello World!

This is the first bit of content I am writing for my new website. This is mostly just to get some words down on the screen and interact with my settings. I could also use the space to soliloquize a bit about my goals for this website. 

## Professional Development

The main reason I have wanted to create my own website was so that I could have somewhere to refer people if they wanted to get to know more about me and the work I do. Soon, I hope this site will be filled with cool projects I have done. 

## Personal Interest

Sometimes I do not know where to direct the constant flurry of thoughts that goes through my head. I hope to use this platform also to write about things that interest me or lingering thoughts that I want to express. 

If you're reading this, I am glad you found my site! If we don't know each other, I hope we will soon. Feel free to reach out to me and share some thoughts (as long as they are nice ;) ).
